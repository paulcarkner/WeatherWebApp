# WeatherWebApp

Weather application built on React and OpenWeatherMap.org

## Functionality

App shows current weather details, charts of up-coming temperature and rain, and a list of weather for the coming week. The lower background shows a map of the current location. The upper background changes colour to match the sky colour, sun and moon procession with the time of day, and cloud quantity and opacity based on current cloud cover.

Locations are stored in localStorage. You can add locations using the button in the bottom menu and remove a location by clicking the pin at the top left corner of the details pane.
